# Shape Management Program

## Overview
This program is designed to manage various geometric shapes like rectangles, squares, circles, and triangles. It allows users to add shapes, translate them, scale them, and retrieve information about their areas, perimeters, and positions. The program is built using C++ and includes basic operations for geometric transformations.

## Features
- **Add Shapes:** Add different types of shapes like Rectangle, Square, Circle, and Triangle by providing dimensions and coordinates.
- **Remove Shapes:** Remove shapes by specifying their center coordinates.
- **Translate Shapes:** Move shapes by specifying the translation in both the x and y directions.
- **Scale Shapes:** Scale shapes up or down by specifying a factor and whether to multiply or divide the dimensions.
- **Display Shape Information:** View detailed information for each shape, including its area, perimeter, and center coordinates.
- **Manage Multiple Shapes:** Keep track of multiple shapes in a collection and apply operations to all of them at once.

## Supported Shapes
- **Rectangle:** Requires width, length, and center coordinates.
- **Square:** Requires side length and center coordinates.
- **Circle:** Requires radius and center coordinates.
- **Triangle:** Requires the coordinates of its three vertices.

## Menu Options
1: Add a new shape.
2: Remove a shape by specifying the center coordinates.
3: Get information about a shape by its center coordinates.
4: View the area and perimeter of a shape by its center coordinates.
5: Display information about all shapes.
6: Translate all shapes by a specified amount in the x and y directions.
7: Scale all shapes by a factor (either multiplying or dividing their dimensions).

## Requirements
C++11 or newer
C++ standard library

## Future Improvements
Add support for more complex shapes (e.g., polygons).
Implement additional transformations, such as rotation.
Add support for persistent storage of shapes across program executions.
